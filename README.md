The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014

Although it is generally agreed that higher income improves life expectancy, the relationship is poorly understood. This study uses 1.4 billion tax records obtained from the Social Security Administration to make estimations on life expectancy at 40 years of age using household income percentile, sex, and geographic area. The study also attempts to determine factors that are associated with differences in life expectancy. There are 4 results produced. First, people with higher income had greater life expectancies overall. The difference between the wealthies 1% and poorest 1% was 14.6 years for men and 10.1 years for women. Second, from 2001 to 2014, the inequality of life expectancy between the wealthy and poor has increased. Third, low income individuals had significant variation in life expectancy across different geographic locations. Finally, the variation for low income individuals has more to do with poor health habits such as smoking rather than environmental or social causes.


A Potential Decline in Life Expectancy in the United States in the 21st Century

This suggests that the US may have reached the peak of the hill for life expectancy. Despite natural disasters, pandemics, and wars, life expectancy has steadily increased over the last thousand years. However, in the past 3 decades, the US life expectancy has significantly decelerated compared to the general trend of increasing life expectancy. The study cites obesity as the main cause of this deceleration and possible shortening of life expectancy. Obesity has increased significantly in the 80s and 90s, leading to a variety of health problems such as diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, increased risk of stroke, cancer heart disease, etc. As of the time the article was written (2005), 28 percent of men and 34 percent of women in the US were obese. The study notes that evere obesity can decrease life expectancy by 5-20 years and that this must be taken into account when forecasting or implementing new policies for Social Security, healthcare, etc.
